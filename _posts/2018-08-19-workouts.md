## <a href="#squats">Squats</a>

Begin by having your feet shoulder width apart and jumping from a neutral position to see where your feet are pointing. That will be your natural standing position that you should be in when squatting. Your toes should be either pointing forward or slightly outwards. Rest the barbell either on your traps or your neck/shoulders. Tuck your neck backwards. Keep your back straight. Keep your core and glutes engaged. Bend down while keeping a stong core and straight back. Continue until your hips break parallel. Push up explosively. All force should be going through your heels.

## <a href="#deadlifts">Deadlifts</a>

Your feet should be in a similar position as your <a href="#squats">squat</a> position. Grab the barbell shoulder width apart slightly outside your knees. Keep your core engaged and back straight while trying to keep the barbell as close to your body as possible. It should almost skim your shins as you pull it up. Keep your knees slightly bent as you perform the motion. Pull your body up into a standing position. Hold for one second. Again, keep the bar close to your shins as you bend down. Try to control the motion going both up and down. **This is a dangerous exercise and easy to mess up. Have someone watch your form or make sure yourself that you are keeping your back straight and not curving at any part of the motion. If your back is curving, lower the weight.**

## <a href="#split-squats">Split Squats</a>

With either a barbell holding it similar to the <a href="#squats">squat</a> position or dumbbells hanging to your sides, keep one leg back onto a flat bench while stepping slightly forward. Bend down until your knee has hit 90 degrees. Do not let you knee pass your toes. Keep your back straight and your core engaged. All force should be going through your heels.

## <a href="#front-step-ups">Front Step Ups</a>

Using a box, step forward similar to climbing stairs. This box should be high enough to be challenging. Drive through the heels in a control motion. Keep your back straight and core engaged. Slowly step back off the box with the same leg.

## <a href="#leg-curls">Leg Curls</a>

Machine-intuitive. Keep your core engaged and control the motion.

## <a href="#seated-calf-raises">Seated Calf Raises</a>

Machine-intuitive

## <a href="#standing-calf-raises">Standing Calf raises</a>

Using a slight incline, start off the ground and lift onto the incline using your toes. Keep your back straight and core engaged.
